# What if technology could help improve conversations online?
_Discussing things you care about can be difficult. The threat of abuse and 
harassment online means that many people stop expressing themselves and give up 
on seeking different opinions._

## Introducing Perspective
_Perspective is an API that makes it easier to host better conversations. The 
API uses machine learning models to score the perceived impact a comment might 
have on a conversation. Developers and publishers can use this score to give 
realtime feedback to commenters or help moderators do their job, or allow 
readers to more easily find relevant information, as illustrated in two 
experiments below. We’ll be releasing more machine learning models later in the 
year, but our first model identifies whether a comment could be perceived as 
“toxic" to a discussion._
